Goodnight Moon is a static site for measuring the readability of text. It's goal is to improve communications internal to an organization.

There are many services like this online, but sending business-critical documents onto the open internet is not secure. To do this securely, perform a security audit of a revision of Goodnight Moon and copy its contents to an internal file server.
